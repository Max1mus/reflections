-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
To let git know that it is a repositary and to start keeping track of files

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
files in the staging area are already ready to be committed, when you add a file to the staging area you are positive that it is working. it lets you add files to the commit as you go, rather than keeping a list in your head.
